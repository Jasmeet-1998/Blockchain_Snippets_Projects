# Blockchain & Solidity Fundamentals

* Blockchain peer to peer network of nodes talking to one  another a distributed environment.

* all nodes have data and code of blockchain on their system.

* All nodes participate to make the Distributed ledger secure.

* All the code in the blockchain is contained in the smart contracts.

* Docs - https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.3/

* Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.

* Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.

* With Solidity you can create contracts for uses such as voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions, and multi-signature wallets.

# Smart Contract

* The code that executed on the Blockchain.

* This tutorial we will be writing a To do List in blockchain.

* Code written in Smart Contract is Immutable.

* Smart Contract are like microservice.

* Once you deploy your smart Contract it cannot be changed.

# Traditional Apps vs Blokchain Smart Contract

* Traditionally

  web browser---> client side application/API---> backend(Business logic) ----> database.

* Smart Contracts

  web browser ---> client side application/API ---> talk directly to blockchain.

  and the blockchain has code written in Ethereum smart contract which will contain all the Business logic.

  And Blockchain itself will act as database.
